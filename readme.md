## Quick Cassandra ETL Example

This project was created as part of Udacity's Data Engineering nanodegree.
Project flow was:
  
  - take various csv files made up of logs, 
  - aggregate them together, 
  - and finally clean and transform them into 3 analytics tables in a local Cassandra cluster.


This repo consists of:

  1) jupyter notebook, which contains code for this project,
  2) csv file which contains the aggregated dataset created in the jupyter notebook and used for loading to Cassandra.
